Please review your translation. Be mindful of the following:

- If the get_translate function stripped any backticks ` make sure to add them back in the same spot, but don't add any backticks that weren't in the source text.
- Make sure your translation has the same amount of f-string placeholder brackets if the source text has them.
- Make sure all markdown formatting and style is the same in your translation.

Print out only your revised translation of the souce text.
